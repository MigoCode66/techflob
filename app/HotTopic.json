  "title": "OpenAI Expands ChatGPT for Businesses",
  "content": "OpenAI this week rolled out new enterprise features for ChatGPT, adding deep integration with workplace tools. A new “Connectors” feature lets ChatGPT access data from a user’s own apps (Gmail, Outlook, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.), so it can incorporate proprietary documents and inbox content into its responsespymnts.com. Another feature, “Record Mode,” can record and transcribe meetings, automatically generating structured summaries with action items. Together, these turn ChatGPT into a “second memory” for teams—able to recall past discussions and draft follow-up planspymnts.com. The updates are clearly aimed at making ChatGPT a productivity hub that competes with Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace tools.",
